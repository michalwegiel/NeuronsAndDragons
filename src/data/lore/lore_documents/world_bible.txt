WORLD BIBLE — “AERATHYS: THE FRACTURED REALM”

1. THE COSMOLOGY OF AERATHYS
1.1 The First Light and the Shattering
Before time began, there was only The First Light, an infinite consciousness dreaming in the void.
From its thoughts came the Seven Prime Echoes—vibrations that shaped existence.
But one Echo grew unstable, ruptured, and shattered the First Light into fragments.
This catastrophe created:
•	Stars (pure shards of Light)
•	Souls (small conscious pieces)
•	Gods (echoes that absorbed vast light)
•	The Depth Below (the void left behind)
The shattered echo became Nharos, the Unspoken, the first cosmic horror.

2. THE GODS
2.1 The Seven Echoed Gods
These gods are neither fully benevolent nor evil — merely embodiments of natural forces.
1.	Aurelyn — The Dawnmother
•	Goddess of the Sun, Life, Growth, Destiny
•	Warm, radiant, but her “destiny” often overrides free will.
2.	Vaelorn — The Nightfather
•	God of Shadow, Mystery, Secrets, Fear
•	Gentle to the weak, cruel to liars.
3.	Eryndor — The Verdant Titan
•	God of Nature, Beasts, Cycles
•	Indifferent, ancient, inevitable.
4.	Solmyr — The Arcane Whisper
•	God of Knowledge, Magic, Memory
•	Kindly teacher; terrifying when secrets are broken.
5.	Kherath — The Forgemaster
•	God of Craft, Metal, War
•	Loves mortals; hates cowardice.
6.	Velastra — The Tidelady
•	Goddess of Seas, Dreams, Emotion
•	Calm one day, devastating the next.
7.	Thalruun — The Quiet Judge
•	God of Death, Afterlife, Balance
•	Never cruel, never kind — only necessary.
2.2 The Broken One
Nharos, the shattered echo, is imprisoned beneath reality.
Its influence is eldritch: whispers, mutations, impossible geometry.
